## :hear_no_evil:  What's all the hullabaloo?  
Want to say "thank you" to people that star and fork your repositories? [Repo Roster](https://reporoster.com) is a simple copy-and-paste way to automatically shout-out those users by displaying their usernames and avatars directly in your README.md file!


## :tada:  Live Examples (for this repo)

### &#8627; Stargazers
[![Stargazers repo roster for @nastyox/Repo-Roster](https://reporoster.com/stars/nastyox/Repo-Roster)](https://github.com/nastyox/Repo-Roster/stargazers)
```markdown
[![Stargazers repo roster for @USERNAME/REPO_NAME](https://reporoster.com/stars/USERNAME/REPO_NAME)](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/stargazers)
```

### &#8627; Forkers
[![Forkers repo roster for @nastyox/Repo-Roster](https://reporoster.com/forks/nastyox/Repo-Roster)](https://github.com/nastyox/Repo-Roster/network/members)
```markdown
[![Forkers repo roster for @USERNAME/REPO_NAME](https://reporoster.com/forks/USERNAME/REPO_NAME)](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/network/members)
```


## :art: Custom styling

Prefer dark mode? Don't want any text? We've got you covered! Find the image URL in the markdown provided above, and add ```/dark``` and/or ```/notext``` before ```/USERNAME/REPO_NAME```! Or, skip editing the markdown yourself by using our [online tool](https://reporoster.com) instead. 


## :zap:  Fast implementation 

To get your own repo rosters, just paste a link to your GitHub repository into [our website](https://reporoster.com), and we'll generate simple markdown for you to paste into your repo's README.md file. **That's all there is to it!** From then on, data about your supporters will automatically update right in your README.md file.
